            <h2>Strongest Trait and Emotion</h2>
            <p>My strongest personality trait is my determination. the reason being there has been a lot of times when i have felt like to give up but i still push onwards cause i know if you want something in life you have to push yourself to aheive it as no one will acheive it for you. MY favorite hobby is exploring new wonders, and it translate to my academic life because as a person who love to explore when introduced to new topics i instantly get locked into it until i understand which expands my knowledge.

            <h2>Favorite Scene, Personal Motto or Quote</h2>
            <p>One of my favorite scenes is from the movie "The Shawshank Redemption". In this scene, Andy Dufresne stands in the rain after escaping from Shawshank prison. It symbolizes freedom, resilience, and the power of hope even in the most challenging circumstances.</p>
            
            <p>My personal motto is, "Embrace the journey, not just the outcome." This quote reminds me to appreciate the learning and growth that happens along the way, rather than solely focusing on the end result.</p>
            <h2>My Hero: Elon Musk</h2>
            <p>My hero is Elon Musk, a visionary entrepreneur and innovator. His relentless pursuit of technological advancement and commitment to solving some of the world's most pressing issues inspire me deeply. Musk's audacious goals, from revolutionizing the electric car industry with Tesla to revolutionizing space travel with SpaceX, demonstrate the power of bold thinking and relentless execution.</p>
            
            <p>His fearlessness in the face of adversity and his ability to envision a future that is both sustainable and interplanetary is awe-inspiring. Musk's dedication to pushing the boundaries of what is possible is a constant reminder that with determination and creativity, we can achieve extraordinary feats.</p>

            <h2>Personality Assessment</h2>
            <p>Based on my Keirsey Temperament Sorter personality test results, I fall into the Artisan category </p>
            <img src="Screenshot 2023-10-11 092938.png" alt="Personality Test Result">
            <h2>Personality Trait: Artisan</h2>
            <p>Being described as an "artisan" resonates with me on a profound level. I find immense joy and fulfillment in hands-on, creative endeavors. Whether it's crafting intricate code or building physical prototypes, I'm at my bestwhen I have the opportunity to bring ideas to life through tangible creations.</p>
            
            <p>The spontaneity that comes with being an artisan allows for exploration and experimentation. I thrive in environments that encourage innovation and value the unique perspectives that artisans often bring to the table. It's in the moments of unstructured creativity that some of my most ingenious solutions have emerged.</p>
            
            <p>However, it's important to strike a balance. While spontaneity is a great source of inspiration, a structured approach is also necessary for ensuring projects are completed efficiently and meet their intended goals. It's about harnessing the artisan spirit to fuel innovation while maintaining the discipline needed for successful execution.
