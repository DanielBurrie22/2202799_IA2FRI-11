            <h2> "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener</h2>
            <h3><b>Pillar Four-</b></h3>
            <h4> The major reason for setting a goal is for what it makes of you to accomplish it.:</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>To set a goal, you need visualize what you wish to achieve and then create a strategy of how you will get there. Setting goals it makes you have sometime a specific target to aim for and it will help you to remain focus, making it more likely for you to stick things out to achive those goals. I myself have set numerous goals over the years and I must agreee that setting goals is quite effective currently my main goal is becoming a software enginerr and to achive that goal I need a computer science degree and having that goal allows me to stay focus enough to spend  sleepless nights to achive it.</p>

            <h3><b>Pillar Five-</b></h3>
            <h4> Everyday has many opportunities, but only one best opportunity.:</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>One must choose between the agony of discipline or the anguish or regret. You must choose wether you want to choose whats best for your future or choose whats best for you in the moment, for reference you could spend the night before a test studying or you could spend it partying if you spent it partying there is a strong posibility that you will regret not studying or you could have chose to study and feel the agony of not going to the party and remaining deciplined. Pillar five states that you must choose the option that will lead you to what you wish to achieve. I always try to prioritze longevity over short-term satisfaction </p>
        </section>
            <h3><b>Pillar six</b></h3>
            <h4> Donâ€™t join an easy crowd; you wont grow. Go where the expectations and the demands to perform are high.:</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>The persons you are around have a direct correlation to how much you achieve and what your personality is. You shouldn't be in a place that allows you to consistently relax as you will not be able grow. If you end up being the smartest person in a room you need to find a second room as if you are not being pressured then you will not this goes for jobs and friends ect in reguards to a job you should always be trying to learn as much as you can and improve your skills and in reguards to friends if your friends are too laid back and dont want to advance their lives you need to find friends who do because they will encourage you to be like them. Hence why I always try to find friends who have goals and aim to achieve said goals </p>
        </section>
            <h3><b>Pillar seven-</b></h3>
            <h4> Formal education will make you a living. Self education will make you a fortune:</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Pillar 7 states that only knowing what was taught whilst in formal education is not enough. I strongly support this statement as formal education is just the basis and numerous persons will have the same knowledge as you  this includes persons years younger than you hence why you must continue to learn on a daily basis as you need to develop as a human and develop your skillsets. If you only know what eveyone else knows you'll be able to survive but if you are able to push ahead and learn more on your own then you will be able to specialize in certain areas and you will be valued higher</p>
